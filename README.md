#### Author: Daniel Klie
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

### `yarn test`

## Important notes
- Folder structure isn't that complex since there're like 4 components
- Project uses react-query and axios
- Components tested with jest and react-testing-library
- Custom hooks poorly tested with testing-library and msw
